    "# What is Fuzzy Matching\n",
    "Fuzzy matching is a technique used to compare and match two strings that are not exactly identical. While the naive approach of comparing strings and checking for equality would only make a direct comparison that is binary and doesn't consider the degree to which two strings might match each other. Fuzzy matching algorithms use various techniques to measure the similarity between two strings, even if they're not exactly identical. These techniques can include things like measuring the number of characters or words that are the same, or looking for common patterns or sequences of characters. By taking a more nuanced approach to comparing strings, fuzzy matching can help identify matches even when there are slight differences or variations in the data being compared."

    "# Use cases of Fuzzy Matching\n",
    "- Clean Customer Data: Companies use fuzzy matching to find and merge duplicate customer records. This helps to keep the customer database accurate and up-to-date, which is important for sales and marketing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Match Medical Records: Healthcare providers use fuzzy matching to match patient records across different hospitals or clinics. This helps to ensure that patients receive consistent and accurate medical care.\n",

    "The Levenshtein distance algorithm is a way to compare two words or strings to see how different they are from each other. It counts how many changes you need to make to one word to turn it into the other. The changes can be deleting a letter, adding a letter, or changing a letter. The fewer changes you need to make, the more similar the words are. "

    "Soundex is an algorithm that is used to index words by their sound, so that similar-sounding words can be matched even if they are spelled differently. It works by taking a word, dropping its vowels (except for the first letter), and assigning a code to each of the remaining consonants based on their sound. Consonants that have the same sound get the same code. The resulting code can then be used to compare words and find matches. "
